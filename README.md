# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This calendar application allows the user to type in and save events at each hour of the day.

## Usage

Upon page load, today's date will display in the header and each time block will be color-coordinated according to the current hour - gray for past, red for present, green for future. When the user inputs text into any time block and clicks the save button, the event text is saved into local storage and persists after the page is refreshed.
